## Begonia Research (February 2024 - September 2025)
For my final Bachelor Biotechnology Project, I was tasked to do a positive selection analysis on Begonia DNA Chloroplast. Based on Xiong et al. (2023) study, there are eight genes that are detected positively selected which are: rpoC1, rpoB, psbE, psbK, petA, rpl22, rpl2, and rps12. I was tasked to do another positive selection analysis on Indonesian Begonia samples taken from Bogor Botanic Gardens (Kebun Raya Bogor) genes (partial rpoC1 and petA) in comparison with Asian Begonia's that are available in NCBI.
